## 2026-07-11 — M-1: project scaffold (spec only)

**Status**: GREEN
**Files changed**: CLAUDE.md, PRD.md, README.md, Log.md, .claude/settings.json, .gitignore
**Tests**: n/a (no code yet)
**Decisions**:
- Fresh, GCS-first rebuild seeded from the `../flight-sim2` design + its lessons. No code
  copied — the .md spec is the deliverable; the model builds from it.
- Stack fixed by PRD: vanilla ES modules + Three.js r128 CDN, Node bridge, no build step.
- Model set to `claude-fable-5` in `.claude/settings.json`.
**Next**:
- **M0 — Lean baseline**: scaffold (package.json, index.html, src/main.js), a flying box
  in a Three.js scene, fixed-step loop + deterministic `window.__advance`, keyboard
  control, first unit test + console-0 check. Ship GREEN, log, commit `M0: baseline`.
**Notes**:
- Read CLAUDE.md then PRD.md before writing any code. PRD wins on conflict.
